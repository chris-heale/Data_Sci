This a repository of all of my files as I attmept to learn Data science from scratch using books and online resources.
The projects are listed below along with a brief description

# German_credit
German_credit.R and .py were designed to assemble and study the German_credit dataset from the UCI machine learning repository at
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data). The codes use the German.doc to pull out the headers and
encoded variables then assembles the dataset as a dataframe.
